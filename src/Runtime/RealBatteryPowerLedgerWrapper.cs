/*
    RealBatteryPowerLedgerWrapper.cs — copy-paste template for third-party mods.

    Talks to RealBatteryPowerLedger (RealBattery.dll) purely via reflection, so your mod never
    needs a hard/compile-time reference to RealBattery.dll. If RealBattery isn't installed,
    every method below returns a safe default (0.0) instead of throwing.

    Usage:
        1. Copy this file into your own mod's source tree (rename the namespace if you like).
        2. Call RealBatteryPowerLedgerWrapper.Init() once (e.g. in a MainMenu KSPAddon) before
           using anything else — Installed will tell you whether RealBattery is present.
        3. Call the methods below like a normal static API; they're no-ops if RealBattery isn't
           installed, so you don't need to guard every call site yourself.

    Mirrors the same "resolve everything by name via reflection, never a hard reference"
    philosophy already used by RealBattery's own KACWrapper.cs (source/Alarms/KACWrapper.cs)
    for its Kerbal Alarm Clock integration.

    Contract reference: RealBatteryPowerLedger.cs (source/Core/RealBatteryPowerLedger.cs) and
    RealBatteryPowerLedger.md (this folder) in the RealBattery repo. ContractVersion this
    wrapper targets: 1. All methods speak plain ElectricCharge (EC) units — RealBattery's
    internal StoredCharge resource and its EC<->SC ratio are not your concern.

    IMPORTANT — this is a REPORTING contract, not a command one: ReportConsumedEc tells
    RealBattery "I consumed this much energy", it does not ask RealBattery to hand energy over.
    Only call it for energy your own mod has already accounted for as spent. RealBattery is the
    sole authority on how that translates into StoredCharge drain, wear and BatteryLife.

    Vendored into TimeForScience 2026-08 (GameData/TimeForScience/notes/ec-consumption.md) -
    provided directly by the author, who is also RealBattery's author. Supersedes the archived
    command-style RealBatteryWrapper.cs (DrainEc/ChargeEc) removed 2026-07-21. Keep this file
    verbatim (namespace included) so future updates can just be copy-pasted back in.
